> # Shuffle the Array : 몫이랑 나머지로 반 나눠서 array 재배열 하는 코딩

### Python

💡Example:

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].


```
class Solution:
    def shuffle(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
        new=[]
        for i in range(2*n):
            new.append(nums[i // 2 + i % 2 * n])
        return new

                
```

💡 Example 1:     
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.

```
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        #candies = [2,3,5,1,3]
        #extraCandies = 3

        cand=[]
        for i in candies:
          if i+extraCandies< max(candies):
            cand.append(False)
          else:
            cand.append(True)

        return cand


```

```
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        M = max(candies)
        return [candy + extraCandies >= M for candy in candies]

> # i<j, num [i]==nums[j] -> goodpair+1

### Python

<br>
💡 Example 1:   
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.


```
class Solution:
    def numIdenticalPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nn=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
          for a in range(i+1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i]==nums[a]:
              nn+=1
            
        return nn
```
